If you are in IRB in your terminal still, get out of it by typing 'exit'.

Download this file from github to your DESKTOP.  You will notice that the extension of the file is '.rb', which is how both you and your computer understand that it is a Ruby file.

Go to your terminal and type 'ls'.  Hit ENTER.  You will see all the files on your DESKTOP. If you see 'skin.rb' on your desktop, you are golden.

Type 'ruby skin.rb'.  Hit ENTER.
